A half adder performs single-bit binary addition with two inputs, producing a sum and carry output.

1. Data persistence analysis:
- No storage elements needed as this is combinational logic
- Outputs depend only on current inputs

2. Operation analysis:
- Sum: XOR of inputs (1 when inputs are different)
- Carry: AND of inputs (1 when both inputs are 1)

3. Data flow:
- Two inputs A and B feed into:
  * XOR gate for sum
  * AND gate for carry
- No feedback paths or dependencies between operations

4. Dependencies:
- No register dependencies as this is purely combinational
- Sum and carry are independent parallel operations

<answer>
INPUTS:
- a: Single bit input
- b: Single bit input

OUTPUTS:
- sum: A XOR B (1 when inputs differ)
- carry: A AND B (1 when both inputs are 1)

OPERATIONS:
1. Sum generation:
   - XOR operation between a and b
   
2. Carry generation:
   - AND operation between a and b

No storage elements required - purely combinational logic
