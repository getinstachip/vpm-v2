A half adder performs binary addition of 2 single bits, producing:
- Sum (S): XOR of inputs A and B
- Carry (C): AND of inputs A and B

No storage elements needed since this is combinational logic.

Data flow:
1. Two 1-bit inputs A and B feed into:
   - XOR gate to produce Sum
   - AND gate to produce Carry
2. No feedback or dependencies between components
3. Pure combinational logic with no state

The half adder is a fundamental building block for larger arithmetic circuits like full adders and ALUs.

STORAGE ELEMENTS:
None (combinational circuit)

DETECTION RULES:
1. Sum output:
   - S = A XOR B
   - High when inputs are different (0,1 or 1,0)
   - Low when inputs are same (0,0 or 1,1)

2. Carry output:
   - C = A AND B 
   - High only when both inputs are 1
   - Low for all other input combinations
